    title: 'Coordinated Line-Following Robots with Obstacle Avoidance',
    description: 'Designed and implemented a coordinated robotic system of two autonomous line-following robots capable of navigating predefined paths while intelligently detecting and responding to obstacles.',
    fullDescription: `This project involves designing and implementing a coordinated robotic system consisting of two autonomous line-following robots capable of navigating predefined paths while intelligently detecting and responding to obstacles. The core objective is to demonstrate synchronized robot behavior through robust real-time communication and precise sensor-driven navigation strategies.


### Technical Specifications

#### Hardware Components
- **MegaPi Controller**: Serves as the central control unit for motor operation and sensor data integration.
- **Line Following Sensor (MeLineFollower)**: Enables accurate tracking along marked paths.
- **Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor (MeUltrasonicSensor)**: Provides obstacle detection within a 20 cm radius.
- **Gyroscope Sensor (MeGyro)**: Ensures stability and accurate directional orientation.
- **Encoder Feedback**: Facilitates precise motor speed and positional control.
- **XBee S2C Module**: Establishes robust peer-to-peer wireless communication (UART) between robots at 9600 bps.


### System Functionality

#### Navigation and Control Logic
Robots autonomously follow designated tracks using line sensors. The gyroscopic feedback and encoder data assist in maintaining stable trajectories and smooth turns, particularly during curves and intersection points. Adjustments to the robot's direction are continuously made based on real-time sensor feedback.


#### Obstacle Detection and Response
When an obstacle is detected by the ultrasonic sensor, the robot executes an immediate stop command and simultaneously transmits a halt signal ('0') through the XBee module to its counterpart. This ensures coordinated stopping, preventing potential collisions and demonstrating collective awareness and interaction.


#### Communication Protocol
Communication between the robots occurs via a UART-based serial protocol implemented through XBee S2C modules. The system uses simplified binary signalingâ€”'1' indicates clearance to proceed, while '0' signals a stop command. This binary scheme ensures low latency and reliable messaging, crucial for synchronized robot operations.


### Application and Impact
This project showcases a foundational framework for autonomous and collaborative robotics applicable to industrial automation, warehouse logistics, and emergency response scenarios. The successful implementation illustrates practical robotics principles, including sensor fusion, wireless communication, and intelligent control strategies, highlighting potential advancements in automated system coordination and collaborative autonomy.`,

    fullDescription: `## Project Overview
This research project investigates the relationship between human needs and depression as expressed in social media posts from the r/depression subreddit. By analyzing how individuals articulate their unmet needs, we aim to understand the bidirectional relationship between unfulfilled needs and depression.


## Motivation & Research Questions
Depression is a complex mental health disorder influenced by psychological, social, and environmental factors. Traditional binary depression detection models provide limited insights into underlying causes. Our study addresses three key questions:

1. Are human needs correlated with depression?
2. How do expressions of needs differ between depressed users and control groups?
3. Can Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively detect needs underlying depressive posts?


## Methodology

### Dataset & Preprocessing
- Collected 20,000 posts each from r/depression and control subreddits
- Focused on English-language posts with sufficient content length
- Removed posts containing images, URLs, and non-textual elements


### Classification Framework
- **Maslow's Hierarchy Classification**:
  - Basic Needs: Physiological, Love, Stability (Safety)
  - Advanced Needs: Esteem, Spiritual Growth
  - None: Posts with no clear need expression

- **Needs Categorization**:
  - Trigger Needs: Unfulfilled needs contributing to depression
  - Effect Needs: Needs emerging due to depression


### Technical Implementation
- Implemented GPT-3 Zero-Shot Classification for need detection
- Designed specialized natural language prompts
- Applied self-verification mechanisms to improve classification accuracy
- Conducted topic modeling (LDA) and linguistic analysis


## Results & Performance

### Key Findings
- Strong correlation between unmet needs and depressive tendencies
- Significant variation in need expression patterns between groups
- GPT-3 demonstrated promising capability with proper prompt engineering


### Model Metrics
- Initial accuracy: ~36.9% (imbalanced data)
- Final accuracy after augmentation: ~58.4%
- Improved precision, recall, and F1-scores across all categories


## Conclusion & Impact
This study introduces a novel approach to analyzing human needs in depressive social media posts. The identified patterns could aid in developing more targeted mental health interventions.`,
